     * DNS while the tunnel is up; a predictable port lets an attacker simply bind it at boot and

     * and covering the range would take more sockets than an app's descriptor limit allows.
     *
     * Both protocols are probed, on the loopback address specifically: a TCP-only probe on the
     * wildcard address would report a port free whose UDP side is already held. SO_REUSEADDR is
     * disabled so the kernel cannot grant a bind to a port already in use.
     *
     * A gap remains between this probe and ctrld's own bind - the sockets must be released for
     * ctrld to take them - so this narrows the window rather than closing it. Closing it needs
     * ctrld to accept an already-bound socket.
